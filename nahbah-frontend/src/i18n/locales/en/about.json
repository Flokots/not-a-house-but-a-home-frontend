    "subtitle": "Members of the Research Group for Solidarity in Architecture of the Faculty of Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pécs, Hungary, and our social psychologist colleagues from the Faculty of Humanities set out to explore the homeless community around Pécs.",
    "paragraph1": "We found friendly homes in many places in huts converted from the tool sheds of former hobby gardens. People who do not have a regular income and cannot get housing on the market live in huts that are isolated from public utilities. They could spend their nights in night shelters and their days in day shelters, but they prefer to live in their huts. Because here they can sleep with the person they love, stay with their pets, and meet their friends. Because here they can live an independent life, even if at a much lower standard than the majority society.",
    "paragraph2": "We, the creators of “Not a House, but a Home,” believe in the power of self-built spaces to bring about stability and dignity. Our goal is to support, inspire, and empower people to build homes that truly feel like home.",
    "paragraph3": "Housing is a fundamental right, yet many people are forced to create their own shelters outside traditional systems. This web application is a resource for those who build homes from found materials, as well as for advocates and architects working in solidarity with unhoused communities.",
    "paragraph4": "A home is more than a shelter—it's a place of stability, privacy, and connection. Through design knowledge, creativity, and shared solutions, we support self-built housing as a pathway to dignity and security.",

    "paragraph2": "We want to help people who choose to live in their own huts instead of night shelters to create safer homes for themselves, even if they can afford neither architects nor new, modern building materials."
