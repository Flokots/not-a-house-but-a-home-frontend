      "description": "The durability of a shelter begins with stability — meaning the structure must stand securely without sagging or collapsing.",
      "considerationsTitle": "Key Considerations",
      "considerations": [
        "Solid foundation: Whenever possible, build the walls on a firm, level surface (e.g., pallets, stones, or concrete slabs) to prevent sinking.",
        "Triangular bracing: Use diagonal members (braces) in wall frames and roof structures to increase rigidity.",
        "Even load distribution: Attach heavier components (like the roof) so that their weight is evenly distributed across the walls and the foundation.",
        "Fastenings and joints: Use screws, wires, ropes, or nails to create stable connections.",
        "Wind protection: When building in an open area, anchor the structure with sandbags, stones, or earth."

      "preview": "Staying Dry",
      "description": "Protecting a structure from rainwater is one of the most important conditions for its durability and safety. If water penetrates the walls, roof, or foundation, it can lead to structural damage, mold, and heat loss.",
      "consequencesTitle": "If You Don't Protect Your Shelter",
      "consequences": [
        "Water will soak and weaken wood- or paper-based materials, which may eventually cause collapse.",
        "Persistent moisture encourages the growth of fungi and bacteria, posing health risks.",
        "Wet walls and floors cool down faster, making the shelter feel colder.",
        "Damp structures lose their original shape, stability, and insulating ability."
      ],
      "methodsTitle": "Simple Protection Methods",
      "methods": [
        "Build the roof with a slope so rainwater can drain away.",
        "Use tarps, plastic sheets, metal pieces, or flattened cans to divert water.",
        "Raise the bottom of the walls off the ground, for example with pallets.",
        "Channel water away using shallow ditches or a layer of gravel around the shelter."

    "groundMoisture": {
      "title": "Dry Ground",
      "preview": "Protection Against Ground Moisture",
      "description": "Moisture rising from the ground can slowly but continuously damage the lower parts of a structure. If a shelter or house is built directly on the ground, this moisture can soak into the floor, walls, and insulation — leading over time to mold, heat loss, and structural weakening.",
      "consequencesTitle": "If You Don't Protect Against Ground Moisture",
      "consequences": [
        "Wood, cardboard, fabric, and other porous materials will rot quickly.",
        "Fungi and insects may multiply, causing allergies and health problems.",
        "A damp floor cools the interior, making the home feel colder.",
        "The lifespan of the structure is significantly reduced."
      ],
      "methodsTitle": "Simple Protection Methods",
      "methods": [
        "Raise the floor using pallets, stones, bricks, or other solid supports.",
        "Add a waterproof layer (tarp, plastic sheet, bitumen membrane, or any water-repellent material) between the ground and the structure.",
        "Provide drainage around the shelter — for example, with gravel, proper slope, or a shallow ditch."

      "whyMattersTitle": "Why It Matters",
      "whyMatters": [
        "Keeps warmth inside during winter: Insulation reduces heat loss, helping the interior stay warm longer.",
        "Protects from heat in summer: It prevents walls and roofs from overheating.",
        "Balances indoor temperature: Helps avoid cold corners and condensation, which can lead to mold.",

      "whyMatters": [
        "Reduces heat loss: In a draft-free space, warm air stays inside, reducing the need for heating.",
